                    Here I reference my &lsquo;official&rsquo; work in
                    theoretical physics, linked to my physics studies as an
                    undergraduate and graduate student. That is, my
                    Bachelor&rsquo;s thesis, my Master&rsquo;s thesis, and
                    puplications in journals.

                    <br>
                    As can be seen by a physicists eye, I transitioned between
                    fields &mdash; from quantum field theory (QED and QCD) to
                    atomic physics and (analogue) quantum simulation. This
                    (somewhat late) transition was due to the fact that for a
                    long time I could not decide between these two fields, I
                    both enjoyed working on &mdash; of course, at least
                    professionally, a desicion was required at some point.

                            <br>
                            Since the first deep inelastic scattering (DIS)
                            experiments in the late 1960&rsquo;s, the
                            differential scattering cross-sections (DSCSs)
                            associated with this process are measured. These
                            quantities are expressed in terms of so-called
                            structure functions, which encode information on the
                            scattering process. From the DSCS measurements these
                            structure functions can be extracted. All of this is
                            done without knowledge about partons or, generally,
                            the target&rsquo;s (e.g., proton&rsquo;s) internal
                            structure. On the other hand, predictions for the
                            DSCSs can also be made based on quantum chromo
                            dynamics (QCD). This leads to an expression for the
                            DSCS in terms of so-called parton distributions,
                            which are directly linked to QCD matrix elements.
                            Comparing the two different descriptions yields
                            important relations between the structure functions,
                            which are obtained through the parton picture. The
                            most prominent example for such a relation is the
                            Callan-Gross relation, connecting the unpolarised
                            DIS structure functions. Generally speaking,
                            relations between structure functions can be tested
                            experimentally, thereby enabling tests of
                            fundamental theories such as QCD, which describe
                            some of the most fundamental processes in our
                            universe.

                            In this thesis we consider polarised DIS and focus on
                            the well-known Wandzura-Wilczek relation. We derive
                            twist-3 contibutions which break this relation and
                            express them in yet different distributions, which
                            are linked to quark-gluon-quark correlators. For
                            these distributions we test a physically motivated
                            model by fitting the free parameters to experimental
                            data, via the programming language FORmula
                            TRANslator (FOTRAN). With the obtained model
                            patameters, we are able to visualise these
                            distributions, thereby unveiling their properties.

                            Rydberg atoms held in optical tweezers feature
                            electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom which
                            can be brought into interaction in a controllable
                            way. Therefore, these systems enable the
                            investigation of phenomena, similar to those studied
                            in molecular physics, but on exaggerated length and
                            time scales. We exploit these interactions to
                            investigate the possibility of building a quantum
                            simulation framework for molecular systems. In our
                            framework, we find that beyond certain coupling
                            strengths, the vibrational motion becomes unstable,
                            and we derive the critical values. Moreover, we
                            derive quantum corrections to the ground state
                            energy of a micrometer-sized diatomic and triangular
                            atom array, which are not captured by the
                            Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We investigate the
                            physical implications of these corrections and find
                            that they are linked to phonon-squeezed states. We
                            further establish their impact on a regime where the
                            triangular array is in a superposition of distorted
                            triangular shapes (Jahn-Teller regime). Finally, we
                            propose a protocol to prepare molecular states whose
                            structure is strongly affected by electron-phonon
                            coupling. Our results show that trapped Rydberg atom
                            arrays indeed offer a versatile platform for the
                            study of quantum phenomena that link to molecular
                            physics.

                            Rydberg atoms held in optical tweezer arrays combine
                            vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom that
                            can be coupled and manipulated at a microscopic
                            level. This opens opportunities for the quantum
                            simulation of artificial molecular systems and
                            offers in particular a platform for probing complex
                            vibronic dynamics in controlled settings with
                            increasing complexity. Tailored interatomic
                            interactions and electron-phonon couplings yield
                            handles for designing electronic state manifolds,

                            molecular instabilities. Furthermore, this quantum
