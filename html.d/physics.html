                    Introduction
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Here I reference my &lsquo;official&rsquo; work in
                    theretical physics, linked to my physics studies as an
                    undergraduate and graduate student. That is, my
                    Bachelor&rsquo;s thesis, my Master&rsquo;s thesis, and
                    puplications in journals.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As can be seen by a physicists eye, I transitioned between
                    fields &mdash; from Quantum field theory (QED and QCD) to
                    atomic phyiscs and (analogue) quantum simulation. This
                    (somewhat late) transition was due to the fact that for a
                    long time I could not decide between these two fields I
                    both enjoyed working on&mdash; of course, at least
                    professionally, a desicion was required at some point.

                            <br>
                            Since the first deep inelastic scattering (DIS)
                            experiments in the late 1960&rsquo;s, the
                            associated differential scattering cross-sections
                            (DSCSs) are measured. These quantities are
                            expressed in terms of so-called structure
                            functions. These structure functions, encoding
                            information on the scattering processe, can thus be
                            extracted experimentally from DSCS measurements.
                            All of this is done without the knowledge about
                            partons and the target&rsquo;s (e.g.,
                            proton&rsquo;s) internal structure. However,
                            predictions for the DSCS can also be made based on
                            quantum chromo dynamics (QCD). This leads to an
                            expression for the DSCS in terms of so-called
                            parton distributions, which are directly linked to
                            QCD matrix elements. Combining both descriptions
                            yields important relations between structure
                            functions, which are found under the assumption
                            that the parton picture is valid. The probably most
                            prominent example for a relation between strcuture
                            functions is the Callan-Gross relation, which is
                            found in the unpolarised case. The relations
                            between structure functions can be tested
                            experimentally, therefore allowing tests of
                            fundamental theories such as QCD, which describe the
                            most fundamental processes in our universe, about
                            which we know up to this day.

                            In this work we consider polarised DIS and focus on
                            the well-known Wandzura-Wilczek relation. We derive
                            the twist-3 contibutions which break this relation
                            and express them in distributions resulting from
                            quark-gluon-quark matrix elements. For these
                            functions we test a physically motivated model by
                            fitting the free parameters to experimental data
                            using the programming language FORmula TRANslator
                            (FOTRAN).

                            Rydberg atoms held in optical tweezers feature
                            electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom which
                            can be brought into interaction in a controllable
                            way. Therefore, these systems enable the
                            investigation of phenomena, similar to those studied
                            in molecular physics, but on exaggerated length and
                            time scales. We exploit these interactions to
                            investigate the possibility of building a quantum
                            simulation framework for molecular systems. In our
                            framework, we find that beyond certain coupling
                            strengths, the vibrational motion becomes unstable,
                            and we derive the critical values. Moreover, we
                            derive quantum corrections to the ground state
                            energy of a micrometer-sized diatomic and triangular
                            atom array, which are not captured by the
                            Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We investigate the
                            physical implications of these corrections and find
                            that they are linked to phonon-squeezed states. We
                            further establish their impact on a regime where the
                            triangular array is in a superposition of distorted
                            triangular shapes (Jahn-Teller regime). Finally, we
                            propose a protocol to prepare molecular states whose
                            structure is strongly affected by electron-phonon
                            coupling. Our results show that trapped Rydberg atom
                            arrays indeed offer a versatile platform for the
                            study of quantum phenomena that link to molecular
                            physics.

                            vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom that

                            level. This opens opportunities for the quantum
                            simulation of artificial molecular systems and
                            offers in particular a platform for probing complex
                            vibronic dynamics in controlled settings with
                            increasing complexity. Tailored interatomic
                            interactions and electron-phonon couplings yield
                            handles for designing electronic state manifolds,

                            molecular instabilities. Furthermore, this quantum

                            quantifying the validity of fundamental concepts,
