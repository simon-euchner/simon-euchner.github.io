                            <i>
                                A simple GTK-4 calendar, inspired by an
                                old-school paper one
                            </i>
                        </p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            Modern-day digital calendars typically come with a
                            plethora of features. This is of course great for
                            people who like these kinds of things. However, I
                            personally do not enjoy software with, in my
                            opinion, unnessecary features. Therefore, I decided
                            to write a simple GTK-4 calendar which does mostly
                            what an old-shool paper calendar does: It allows
                            one to add a (text-based [monospace]) note to a
                            specific day and mark it. Apart from providing a
                            general window, not associated to a specific day,
                            to place notes in, and marking the current day,
                            there is no more functionality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The calendar is completely written in C using the
                            GTK-4 headers. There is no binary distribution of
                            the software. The application should be build by
                            the user dircetly. This allows maximal control and
                            a very simple and direct way of customising the the
                            calendar&rsquo;s appearance through a single C
                            source file. No weird configuration file formats
                            and alike.

                        <p>
                            The library AlkCalc is a collection of simple
                            programs (written in C and FORTRAN) which allow to
                            numerically compute single-electron bound states of
                            alkali-metal atoms and alkaline-earth-metal ions by
                            employing a so-called &lsquo;parametric model
                            potential&rsquo;. For more details, theory, and
                            documentation, please see the README on GitHub
                            (available in both english and german; link down
                            below).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The software consists of two parts: The first part
                            is used for data generation, more precisely, for
                            numerially computing eigenenergies and radial
                            eigenstates. The resulting data is stored and
                            subsequently used by the second part, which consists
                            functions. These functions provide an easy-to-use
                            interface to numerically extract eigenenergies,
                            eigenstates, Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, and
                            (virtually) arbitrary radial matrix elements, from
                            the data generated with the first part.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            AlkCalc is very much &lsquo;hands-on&rsquo; in the
                            sense that it is simple enough to directly interact
                            with the source code. Further, because it is written
                            in a low-level language (conforming to the C99
                            standard) it is virtually platform independent.
                            Importantly, since high-level languages typically
                            come with easy-to-use protocols to call C code (e.g.
                            Ctypes or Cython for Python), writing an interface
                            to AlkCalc for the high-level language of choice
                            (for instance Python, Julia, Matlab, etc. &mdash;
                            whatever is popular these days) is straight-forward.
                            Therefore, AlkCalc shall not just be seen as a
                            ready-to-use software package, but also as a basis
                            for development of other software packages for
                            high-level languages.

                            While working on my master&rsquo;s thesis it became
                            clear to me, that for the &lsquo;quick-and-dirty
                            (basic)&rsquo; simulations I run on a daily basis, I
                            always need the same numerical quantities. Therefore
                            I descided to write a small software library to
                            avoid writing the same computer code over and over.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To implement this library I decided to use the
                            scripting language Python, since it offers an easy
                            to use interface to well-tested and fast FORTRAN,
                            etc., code. I definitly took concepts from
                            <a href="https://qutip.org">QuTiP</a>, which I
                            hereby reference.

                            I was frustrated that using sparse matrices in C is
                            somehwat convoluted, because one typically needs to
                            install huge packages of software, e.g.,
                            <a href="https://sparse.tamu.edu/"><em>
                            SuiteSparse</em></a>, which come with rather thin or
                            no documentation. In order to not install a lot of
                            software I do not need, just to obtain a basic
                            sparse matrix library, I descided to code one up
                            myself. The result is the present software.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The library is mainly designed for useage directly
                            in a C program, although I remark it is
                            straight-forward to code up a
                            <a href="https://www.python.org/"><em>
                            Python</em></a>,
                            <a href="https://julialang.org/"><em>Julia</em></a>,
                            etc., interface. Of course, high-level languages,
                            typically, already come with a sparse matrix
                            library, such that I definitely view the main
                            application area of the library to be directly in C.

                            I focused on a simple design and only the most basic
                            functionality. However, because of the
                            library&rsquo;s simplicity it is straight-forward to
                            add desired functionality as needed.

                            I was curious how the protocol and its

                            some basics, I coded up this simple example Wayland

                            typically use is the one stated above. However, I

                            interface to the original FORTRAN source code, such
                            that I do not need to do it every time I need the
                            integrator.

                            functionality the original code offers, but only
                            the main functionality I tyically use.
